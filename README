#--- Notes ------------------
#----------------------------

# This requires the following python modules
# and was tested using the following versions
MLB-StatsAPI       1.8.1
pypdf              5.4.0

#----------------------------
#--- one-time only setup ----
#----------------------------

# This was developed using a Mac Mini and python 3.13.0
# meaning you must use a python virtual environment to
# install additional requirements.  Don't blame me,
# that was a decision upstream python made.  Ugh.

# install the python modules
python3 -m venv mlb-lineup-writer
source mlb-lineup-writer/bin/activate
pip3 install MLB-StatsAPI pypdf

# install your input.pdf template file
cd mlb-lineup-writer
    copy all these files into that directory

# pick your desired favorite team
At the top of the python script uncomment the name of your
desired team.  I highly recommend the Philadelphia Phillies :-)

# lastly....
Make sure your "input_filename" in the top of mlb-lineup-writer
points to a PDF template in the same working directory.  The 
default as shipped here is my customized variant of the generic
scorecard from thirty91press.com (thanks Lou!)

#----------------------------
#--- to run the program -----
#----------------------------

cd mlb-lineup-writer
source bin/activate
python3 mlb-lineup-writer

# your output will be in output.pdf in this directory
# or whatever "output_filename" in the mlb-lineup-writer
# script points to.

Go appropriately wild :-)
